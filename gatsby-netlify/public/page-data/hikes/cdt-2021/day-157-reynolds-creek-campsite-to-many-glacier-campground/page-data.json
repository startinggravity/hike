There's bound to be outstanding scenery or gorgeous weather to lift my spirits. Or perhaps the day is made memorable by unexpected trail magic or an encounter with wildlife.

As a precaution, I called out, \"Hey bear!\" a few times until the trail was less overgrown.</p>\n"},"field_image":{"alt":"A sign says a trail is closed"},"relationships":{"field_image":{"gatsbyImage":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/4d7d0ce43f16ef555859fa8f02699043/day157-closed-min.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D256%26h%3D144%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 256w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/d0df54a7b88f4300419c399e389a64ea/day157-closed-min.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D512%26h%3D288%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 512w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/5673850f909e09125034b102d0bc5050/day157-closed-min.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D1024%26h%3D576%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 1024w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/67c2f3b8e562820c290d1876dcafc0bb/day157-closed-min.avif?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D2048%26h%3D1152%26fm%3Davif%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 2048w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/f5c5911b066791d1e1be586b52ad19ec/day157-closed-min.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D256%26h%3D144%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 256w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/8bcc77f7b3b98a454fa51fb314e973b1/day157-closed-min.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D512%26h%3D288%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 512w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/6cd53a21b5a552d173a1bec2e92c2dfc/day157-closed-min.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D1024%26h%3D576%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 1024w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/4b0264b81c2ecf2c8e756e2de0cfdb25/day157-closed-min.webp?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D2048%26h%3D1152%26fm%3Dwebp%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 2048w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}],"fallback":{"src":"/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/e71a0ddd61f0d509df9e128e0b0e37c5/day157-closed-min.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D256%26h%3D144%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6","srcSet":"/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/e71a0ddd61f0d509df9e128e0b0e37c5/day157-closed-min.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D256%26h%3D144%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 256w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/5807eeba34ec2bad4e6dcddfaa42b76d/day157-closed-min.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D512%26h%3D288%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 512w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/1b8c355096e7880679b70ddd347f08d1/day157-closed-min.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D1024%26h%3D576%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 1024w,/_gatsby/image/0fabd8c8d7f9fee822e4621bd1b984de/5305f6da5e4b61daaf69a8375c4a698e/day157-closed-min.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-hike-with-gravity.pantheonsite.io%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fblog-images%2Fbody-images%2F2023-09%2Fday157-closed-min.jpeg&a=w%3D2048%26h%3D1152%26fm%3Djpg%26q%3D75&cd=ba7a6b982198ec7452d1786e230743d6 2048w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1024,"height":576,"backgroundColor":"rgb(136,136,104)"}}}},{"__typename":"paragraph__body_image","field_body_image_caption":{"processed":"<p>I was unsure which trail Top O' and the others had taken.
