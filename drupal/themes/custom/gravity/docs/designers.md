## For Designers

Designers, this section is for you. It'll help get you prototyping in a way that will allow your work to be integrated easily with Drupal.

### Design Process for this project

For the design of this project we want to design systemically and share that design as live comps. We design using the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) system.

* **Atoms** are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.
* **Molecules** are where things start to get more tangible as we start combining atoms together. Example, a search form comprised of a label, input and submit button.
* **Organisms** allow us to combine molecules into something relatively complex, such as a distinct section of the interface. Example, the header or footer of a site.
* **Templates** consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action. Example, article node page.
* **Pages** are specific instances of templates. Here, placeholder content is replaced with real representative content to give an accurate depiction of what a user will ultimately see.

We accomplish this by using [Pattern Lab 2](http://patternlab.io/) with Twig. Because both Pattern Lab and Drupal 8 use Twig for templates, this means that the design components that get built can be used directly by Drupal! ðŸŽ‰

### Requirements

1. **Node 5.0 or higher**, preferrably installed using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
2. [**Gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/)
3. [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org/)

_If you're having issues with requirements, see the troubleshooting section below._

### How to use Pattern Lab

Organizing components using the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) system and seeing those components come to life in Pattern Lab is extremely rewarding. It's worth taking a few moments to read the [Pattern Lab documentation](http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html). Below are a few basic principles.

1. **Structure:** All components (all HTML, CSS, JS) are housed in the `components/_patterns` directory.
2. **Global mixins, code:** Code that is global belongs in `components/_patterns/00-base`. By default, there are files for mixins, variables, breakpoints, layout, and more.
3. **Building a component:** A component is commonly comprised of an HTML file (Twig in our case), a CSS file (Sass in our case) and possibly a Javascript file. `components/_patterns/01-atoms/02-text/00-headings/heading-1` is a good example of a simple h1 component. Please store all code for a component together inside the component's directory.
4. **Pattern-Lab Specific:** Pattern Lab allows you to use YML or JSON files to provide filler data in your components. You can also provide component notation via a markdown file. See `components/_patterns/01-atoms/06-buttons` for an example of both of these inside a component, as well as an example of easily [providing component variants](http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-pseudo-patterns.html).
5. **Drupal-related:** You may notice that there are files not organized into components such as `_block.twig`, `_node.twig`. You can likely ignore these files for your work, but you can use this underscore-first file naming convention for any components that you *don't* want to show up in Pattern Lab.

### Troubleshooting

#### Node

1. `node -v` to check the version of node. If it returns a version number it is installed.
2. If you don't have node installed, see if you have nvm installed by running `command -v nvm`. (Most likely you don't have nvm installed.) If it returns `nvm` it is installed.
3. If nvm is not installed, run the [nvm install script](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script), open a new Terminal window (closing the old one), then `command -v nvm` again to confirm that it is installed.
4. If `command -v nvm` fails, type `vi ~/.bash_profile` and see that the file that is opened in the Terminal has the following in it, `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm`. To exit, type `:q` and return. (If you run into trouble, search for VIM help.)
5. Run `nvm install node` to install the latest version of node.

#### Composer

1. `composer about` will return a description of composer. If it doesn't, then you'll need to install it.
2. `cd ~` this puts you in Home folder. We'll install it here first and then move it.
3. `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php` this installs composer.
4. `sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer` to move composer.phar and rename it to simply "composer". You will have to enter your password for this command.
